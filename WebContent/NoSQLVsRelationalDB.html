<title>NoSQL VS Relational DB</title>
</head>
<body>
<ol>
	<li>NoSQL databases feature dynamic schema, and allow you to use what’s known as “unstructured data.” Basically, this means you can build your application without having to first define the schema.
	</li>
	<li> Relational databases are table-based. NoSQL databases can be document based, graph databases, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores.
	</li>
	<li>Relational databases are vertically scalable, but typically expensive. Scaling a NoSQL database is much cheaper because you can add capacity by scaling horizontally over cheap, commodity servers.
